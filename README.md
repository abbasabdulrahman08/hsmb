# 🏥 Hospital Services Management Board

## 📖 Overview
The **Hospital Services Management Board (HSMB)** project is designed to streamline hospital operations, improve patient record management, and enhance communication between healthcare departments through secure digital systems.

This project demonstrates my technical skills in **networking**, **cybersecurity**, and **hardware/software maintenance**, while showcasing how IT solutions can optimize healthcare delivery.
